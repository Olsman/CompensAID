Purpose:
To investigate whether CXCR6-deficiency alters the house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthmatic response and the influx of leukocytes into the airways.

Experimental Design:
Comparison of wildtype and CXCR6-deficient mice following HDM-induced allergic asthma.

Sample Treatment:
Adult mice were sensitized intratracheally with 1μg HDM in PBS. Seven days later, they were challenged intranasally with 10μg HDM for 5 consecutive days, as described by Willart et al. (J Exp Med 2012; 209(8):1505–1517).

Fluorescence Panel:
CD19 (1D3), CD3 (145-2C11), TCRγδ (GL3), TCRβ (H57-597), CD4 (RM4-5), CD8 (53-6.7), NK1.1 (PK136)

Instrument:
